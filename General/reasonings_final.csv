Key;Reasoning
22168020;To create the output first the input is copied and then zero-values between two non-zero values turned into the same non-zero values they are surrounded with. Dimensions: Output dimensions therefore are the same as in the input. Values: The output uses the same values as the input. Changes values: As explained earlier the only values that change are the horizontal lines of zero values between two non-zero values.
23581191;First the input is copied and then for each non-zero value we fill a horizontal and vertical line with the same non-zero value. If two lines cross each other the entry gets the value 2 at that point. Dimensions: Therefore the output dimensions are the same as the input dimensions. Values: The non-zero values of the input define the values on the added vertical and horizontal lines (except in the case of crossed lines). Changed Values: For each non-zero value in the input the whole vertical and horizontal line of that entry will be changed.
29623171;First the input is copied into the output. Secondly the we see the two-dimensional grid as a nine three by three grids divided by the values equal to five. Then we look at the three by three grids and observe the one with the most non-zero values x in it. There can be multiple with the most non-zero values x in it. Once observed the three by three grids with the most non-zero values x are turned into a three by three grid where all values are x. All other three by three grids are zerod out while the fives remain. Dimension: The output has the same dimensions as the input. Values: Following the general rule explained earlier there are usuall only two non-zero values used one is 5 and one is dependent on the input we call it x. Changed values: Following the rule earlier we on one hand change the values in the three by three grid with the most non-zero values and we change the non-zero values to zero which are in the other three by three grids.
32597951;First the input is copied and then one looks at the rectangle that is formed by the eights and observes which 1 value overlaps with the rectangle of the eights. Once the overlapping ones got identified they are turned into the value 3. Dimension: The input and the output has the same dimension as we only modify the values of the copied input and don't add anything. Values: The only values used are eights, threes, ones, and zeros. Changed values: Following the explanation only the one values are changed which seem to be overlapping with the rectangle of eights.
40853293;First the input is copied and then we look for two equal values in the same line no matter if it is a horizontal or vertical line. Once we identified such a pair we set every value between these two values to the same value as the identified pair has. If two lines cross each other the value of the vertical line has priority. Dimension: The dimensions stay the same as we copy from the input but don't add anything, we only change values within the same dimensions. Values: Based on the description earlier we only use values seen in the input. Changes values: Based on the description earlier we only change zero-values inbetween two equal values and cross points of two lines where we have grant the priority value to the vertical line.
50846271;First the input is copied and then the values equal to two are identified. Values equal to two indicate a subset of a pluss sign with five vertical points and five horizontal points. Since the values equal to two are usually only subset they are filled up to the 5 by 5 plus sign with values equal to eight. All the other values which don't interfere with the 5 by 5 plus signs aren't changed. Dimension: The dimensions stay the same since the input is copied and nothing is added only values within the given dimensions are changed. Values: The only used values are in the solution should be 0,5,2, and 8. If a value is change from input to output is has to be change to 2 since these are the only values we add. Changed values: Only values not equal to eight are changed which interfere with the imagined 5 by 5 plus sign.
63613498;First the input is copied then one observes which structure is displayed in the top left corner and memorizes the valuex held by the structure. By displayed I mean which one is surrounded by the dimension boundaries and fives. Once the displayed structure and the value x is known one searches in the rest of the grid for this structure and if found lessens the value y of the outer structure by x. All other entries stay untouched. Dimension: This means that the dimension stays unchanged since we don't add anything and only change values from the copied input. Values: The only values used are therefore the same values as seen in the input and x-y (if x-y<0 then use 0). Changed values: Only the the tiles which have the same structure as the displayed one in the top left corner are changed everything else remains the same.
82819916;First the input is copied and then the pattern of the horizontal top non-zero line which goes from the left bound to the right bound is observed and memorized. The patter is then copied to each indicated line just with the respective values of the line-indication. A line is indicated if the first three values from left to right are non-zero. Dimension: The dimensions therefore stay the same. Values: Only values that are used in the input are used in the output again. Changed values: Only zero values being in the same row as an indicated line will be changed.
91413438;First the zero-values of the three by three input are count assume that there are x zero values. Then the dimensions are set such that the width and height are (x times 3). As it is a three by three grid the non-zero values are therefore 9-x. Now going from left to right and top to bottom insert (9-x) three by three consecutive input grids without them overlapping each other. Dimension: This means for the dimensions of the output that it is a (x times 3) by (x times 3) grid. Values: The used values are the same as seen in the input. Changed values: The values changed therefore depend on the input three by three grid in a sense that we copy the input grid consecutively into the output grid without overlapping. By non-overlapping I mean that if we insert the grid at the top left corner (0,0) the next copied input grid can only start at (3,0).
95990924;First the input is copied and then one observes the squares of fives. Once they are observed one takes a diagonal step into the zero value at each corner five and changes the value as follows: if step taken from the top left corner change value to 1. If step taken from the top right corner change value to 2. If step taken from the bottom left corner change value to 3. If step taken from the bottom right corner change value to 4. Dimension: The input dimension is therefore the same as the output dimension. Values: The only values used in the output should be 0,1,2,3,4,and 5. Changed values: Change only the values which are part of the surrounding frame of zeros which surround the squares of fives. 
97999447;First the input is copied. Then for each non-zero value x we complete a horizontal line to the right of that value by alternating the value x and five until the boundarie is reached. Do that for all non-zero values of the copied input. Dimension: As we only change values within the boundaries of the copied input and don't add anything the dimensions of input and output are the same. Values: Only use the seen values of the input and five. Changed values: Only change values to horizontal right of non-zero values from the copied input.
007bbfb7;Each non-zero entry in the input takes the whole input-grid and copies it into the position the non-zero entry was without changing the value. From that follows: Dimension: The input dimensions get squared. Values: The non-zero entries don't differ in values from input to output. Changed values: Copy the whole input grid into the same position of the output grid if the value is non-zero at that position in the input-grid.
00d62c1b;First the input gets copied and second the encircled zero values of the input are turnt into the same non-zero value in the output. From that follows: Dimension: Going from input to output the dimension stay the same. Values: The non-zero entries of the input have the same non-zero value in the output. The encircled zero values receive all the same non-zero value which is different from the non-zero values of the input. Changed values: Only the encircled zero values of the input change their values to non-zero values.
017c7c7b;First the input gets copied and then the top 3x3 grid gets appended to the bottom such that the pattern is enlarged by one 3x3 block. The non-zero values used all change uniformly to another non-zero value. From that follows: Dimension: Since a 3x3 grid is appended at the bottom the width dimension of the grid stays the same but the height of the grid is enlarged by three. Values: All non-zero values change their non-zero value uniformly to the same new non-zero value. Changed values: All non-zero values are changed as described and the newly appended 3x3 grid follows the same non-zero pattern as the top 3x3 grid just with the new non-zero value.
025d127b;First the input is copied and then one observes each structure of equally values non-zero values. The observed structures have a bottom part which is shaped like a L which has fallen to the left, this fallen L of the structure is stationary and won't change in the output. The rest of the structure is all shifted one tile to the right. Dimension: The dimension is the same in the input and the output since the only thing we do is shifting a part of the structure to the right. Values: The used values are the same as in the input. Changed values: The changes values are only the left and right boundarie values of the part of the structure being moved and the zero-values to the right of the moving part of the structure where the structure is moved to.
045e512c;First the input is copied and the base structure of non-zero values is observed. One can find the base structure by obsering the structure which is a superset of all the other structures. Once this base structure is obeserved it is continued for the unfinished indication of the structer with the same pattern and value showed by the indication. Dimension: As we copy the input and only work on the values within the copied boundaries the dimensions of input and output are the same. Values: Also we only use values already seen in the input since the only thing indicating a value usage are values used in the input. Changed values: Only change values that lie on line drawn from the base structure to the indicated structure and only change values used to fulfill the indicated base structures.
0520fde7;Imagine the 5 values as wall seperating two 3 by 3 grids. Then observe within the seperated 3 by 3 grids which one values would overlap when one would combine the 3 by 3 grids. The create a 3 by 3 output grid and turn the positions of the overlapping ones to the value 2. Dimension: The output has the dimension of the two seperated grids in our case this is 3x3. Values: Only use zero and two in the output. Changed values: Only change the value of the position which would be overlapping one values when one would lay the two seperated 3x3 grids over each other.
5269061;First copy the input and look the three example diagonals then continue the pattern by taking the value of a diagonal, skip the following two diagonals and then change the zero-values diagonal to the memorized value. Do that with all three example diagonals and the output should usually be diagonally striped grid. Dimension: Since nothing is added nor is it cut of the input and the output have the same dimensions. Values: The values used in the output should only be non-zero and only the seen non-zero values fom the input should be reused. Changed values. Since the diagonally striped pattern has to be set up only change the zero values from the copied input.
05f2a901;Copy the input and only change the position of the structure with the values equal to 2, the structure with the values 8 remains untouched. The structure of the values with 2 is shifted towards the structure with the values 8 such that both structures touch each other but don't overlap. Dimension: The input and output have the same dimension since the only modification is the shifting of the structure filled with 2s. Values: The only values used are 0, 2, and 8. Changed values: Only change the values such that the shifting effect is created without showing any modifications along the shifted way.
06df4c85;First copy the input then imagine it as many 2x2 grids divided by the the fours. Once that is understood find 2x2 grids that have the values (x) in it and connect them by making all the zero values along the way to value x. When connecting them always move in a straight line to the nearest 2x2 grid having the same input values. Do that for all 2x2 grids which have a partner 2x2 grid with the same value. Dimensions: The output has the same dimension as the input. Values: The values used are all seen already in the input. Changed values: Only change zero values connecting two partnering 2x2 grids with the same value in a straight line of 2x2 grids divided by the fours.
08ed6ac7;First the input is copied and then one has to image the different values as bars of fives. The fourth biggest bar will be turned into values of 4, the third biggest to values of 3, the second biggest to values of 2, and the biggest to values of 1. Dimension: As we only copy the input and change the values of the bars the dimension stays the same. Values: The only used values in the output will be 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Changed values: Only the values equal to five in the copied input will be changed in the input.
09629e4f;Look at the input grid and imagine it as nine 3x3-grids divided by line of values equal to five. Then look at each of the 3x3 grids and search for the one with just four non-zero values in it and memorize it. Once this grid has been detected create nine 3x3 grids divided by lines of fives and copy the pattern of the 3x3 grid memorized earlier just into bigger scale. This means for example if the top left entry of the memorized 3x3 grid is red then the top left 3x3 grid of the output should all be red. Dimension: The dimension of the output therefore is the same as seen in the input. Values: The used value are 0,5, and the four values seen in the memorized 3x3 grid of the input. Changed values: Starting from nine 3x3 grids filled with zeros and divided by lines of fives we change the 3x3 grids which are at a position of a non-zero value in the memorized 3x3 grid of the input.
0962bcdd;First copy the input then observe the non-zero plus structures and extend the middle value diagonally for two entries in each diagonal direction. Also extend the outer values by one in each straight direction. Dimension: As we copy the input and don't add anything we the output dimension is the same as the input dimension. Values: Only use the values seen in the input. Changed values: Only change the value in a diagonal line from the middle of the plus structure and the ones next to the outer values of the plus structure.
0a938d79;First copy the input then detect the non-zeron values and complete vertical lines with the same value. Then detect the pattern and continue it to the right until the boundaries are reached. Dimension: The dimensions stay the same because we copy the input and don't add anything to it other than changing zero values. Values: All values in the output have to be seen in the input already. Changed values: Only change value on a vertical line of the initial non-zero values of the input and zero values which lie on the pattern positions we want to continue.
0b148d64;There are three regions with the same value x and one region with another value y in the input. Look at the region with value y and create the output such that the region perfectly fits into it without changing any value. Dimension: The dimension depends on the region of value y, it should be rectangular in such a sense that it perfectly fits the region with value y into it. Values: The only values used in the output will be 0 and y. Changed values: Technically values aren't changed just parts of the input are cut off.
0ca9ddb6;First copy the input and then extend each value equal to 2 with a 4 in each diagonal direction and extend each value of 1 in each horizontal and vertical direction with a value of 7. This gives the desired output. Dimension: The dimension stays the same as the input is copied and not extended afterwards. Values: The values used in the output are the ones already seen in the input plus 1 and 7. Changed values: Only change 0 values being directly next to a 2 in a diagonal sense and zero values being horizontally or vertically next to a 1.
0d3d703e;Copy the input and change values as following (1->5,2->6,3->4,4->3,5->1,6->2,8->9,9->8). Dimension: The dimensions stay the same since we copy from the input and only change the values. Values: The used values depend on the seen values in the input following the rule described earlier. Changed values: Every value is changed when going from input to output.
0dfd9992;First copy the input then the only goal is to get rid of the zero-values destroying the pattern which is already visible. Figure out the underlying pattern and change the zero values step by step by looking for other parts in the input which look similar and see how they were handled in that case. Dimension: Dimensions stay the same since we only copy the input and change the zero values but don't extend it. Changed values: Change only zero values from the copied input.
0e206a2e;First copy the input then look at the connected structure and think about how it needs to be rotated such that it can fit into one of the distributed entries of non-zero values. Do that for both connected structures. Once this is figured out shift and rotate them such that they overlap the distributied non-zero values and fill the old position with zero values. Dimension: The dimension stays the same since we copy the input and don't extend it. Values: All values used in the output are already seen in the input. Changed values: Change the values of the old positions of the connected structures to 0 and change the values of the new positions such that they resemble the connected structures from the input again.
10fcaaa3;First double the dimension of the input then copy the input 4 times. One time paste it into the top left corner,then the top right, then the bottom left, and then the bottom right. Once done look at each non-zero value in the grid thats created and extend the neighboring diagonal entry of each non-zero value in a sense that you change the value if it is 0 to 8. The resulting grid is the solution. Dimension: The dimensions are double along both axis. Values: Only use values already seen in the input and 8. Changed values: Change the values being zero and a diagonal neighbor of the grid you prepared with copying the input four times into the new dimensions.
11852cab;Copy the input and then extend the already started structure such that is becomes a 5x5 structure where non-zero values are only neighboring diagonally and the pattern of the non-zero values follow the started structure from the input. Dimension: The dimension stays the same since we only copy the input and then change values. Values: The values used in the output are all already seen in the input. Changed values: Change only zero values to fulfill the structure desired and never change a zero value such that two non-zero values are neighboring horizontally or vertically.
1190e5a7;Observe the input and try to find the domination value. There is one dominating value and one value only used for seperating. Once understood detect how many seperated regions of the dominating value there is and use the outcome as dimensions. If there 3 seperated regions of the dominating value horizontally and 5 vertically then create a output which is 3x5 and fully filled with the dominating value. Dimension: The dimension is key here and depends on the amount of seperated regions of the dominating value horizontally and vertically. Values: The only used value is the dominating value of the input. Changed values: Once the grid with the right dimension is created fill each entry with the dominating value.
137eaa0f;Look at the input and detect the different connected non-zero structures. Each has one five value to it. To produce the output one has to create a 3x3 grid and first put the 5 value in the middle entry. Then one has to fill the rest of the grid in the same manner in which the non-zero values are located to the 5 value. Dimension: The output dimension is a 3x3 grid. Values: All values used in the output grid were seen in the input. Changed values: There is no real changing of values since the output grid is built step by step.
150deff5;First the input is copied then one has to divide the structure consisting of 5s into parts of 2x2 squares and 3-entry lines (no matter if they horizontal or vertical). Once this classification is done turn all 2x2 sections into the value 8 and all lines with length 3 into the value 2. Dimension: The dimension is the same since we copy the input and then just change values and don't extend anything. Values: The used values in the output will only be 0,2, and 8. Changed values: Change every non-zero values to 8 or 2 depending on the classification necessary to seperate the strucutre distinctively into these two types of structures.
178fcbfb;First copy the input and then detect all the non-zero values. Once they got detected extend 2 values into a vertical line of 2s and extend 3s and 1s into horizontal lines of 3s or 1s respectively. If lines cross at an entry choose the horizontal line value. Dimension: The dimension in the input and the output stays the same since the input is copied and then only values are changed but the grid is not extended. Changed values: Only value in a vertical line to a 2 or in a horizontal line to a 3 or 1 are changed.
1a07d186;First the input is copied and one has to detect the vertical lines of non-zero values. Once they are understood look at the freely distributed non-zero values not being part of a vertical line. Each of these values is pulled towards the vertical line with the same value like gravity such that it ends up being a one-entry-extension into a horizontal direction of the line. If the value was located on the left site of the line it will extend the line in that row to the left site by one value. Vice versa on the right site. At the end once all freely distributed values with partner lines have been combined turn each value without direct connection to a vertical line to zero. Dimension: The dimension stays the same since the input is only copied but not extended. Neither does it follow another rule causing the output dimension to differ from the input dimension. Values: The used values in the output will only by the values represented in a vertical line in the input and zero. Changed values: All freely distributed non-zero values without partner line will be turned to zero. The left or right neighboring entry to a line will be turned to the value of the line if there is a partnering freely lying value in that row to the left or right of that line.
1b2d62fb;In the input are two 5x3 sections divided by a vertical line of 1s. Look at both sections and search for the positions where both 5x3 grids have a zero value. Then create an output grid with only 0s of the dimensions 5x3. Then change the value of the positions where both sections of the input have a zero into the value 8. Dimension: Following to the overall rule the output dim will be 5x3. Values: The only used values in the output will be 0 and 8. Changed values: As explained in the overall rule only change the positions where both sections of the input have a 0 into and 8 in the 5x3 output grid.
1b60fb0c;First copy the input and then observe the unfinished structure where 3 time the same structure is shown with values of 1s. Complete the structure such that it is symmetric by adding the unfinished part with values of 2s. Dimension: The dimension of the output is the same as the dimension in the input. Values: Only values 0,1, and 2 are used in the output. Changed values: 0s which are in the position where the unfinished structure should be are changed to 2s.
1bfc4729;Copy the input and then look at the structure the other output examples created. Do the same but with the two non-zero values shown in the current input. Dimension: The dimension stays the same since the input is only copied and changed but not extended. Values: The used values in the output are only 0 and the two non-zero values of the input. Changed values: 0s which are in a position where the final structure should be are turned into distance-wise nearest non-zero value.
1c786137;First one has to detect the frame indicated by one constant non-zero value. Once this is done just look at the entries in the frame and use exactly them with the respective dimensions as output. Dimension: Depends on the region in the frame. Values: Used values in the output are all seen in the frame of the input. Changed values: No values are changed at all only the region the frame is copied.
1caeab9d;There are three connected non-zero structure one of them having the value 1. Copy the input and bring all the structures to the same row-range as the structure with value 1 occupies. Dimension: The input dimension is the same as the one which will be used in the output. Values: All values used in the output are 0,1,2, and 4. Changed values: Change the values such that all structures are on the same height as the structure with the 1s all other values should be 0.
1cf80156;The is only one connected non-zero structure in the input. The output is created by cutting this non-zero structure out. I.e. cut everything of such that the structure exactly fits into the resulting rectangular. Dimension: The dimension of the output is such that the non-zero structure fits exactly into that rectangle. Values: All used values will be already seen in the input. Changed values: There is no change in values happening since only unnecessary overhang is cut off.
1e0a9b12;Look at the input and assume gravity to the bottom exists like in tetris. Just apply that rule to the input and the resulting implications and changes will give the output. Dimension: The dimension of the output is the same as the input has. Values: All used values in the output have been seen in the input. Changed values: Change the values such that the effect of gravity seems to have been applied, i.e. there cannot be vertically zero values between non-zero values.
1e32b0e9;Look at the input there are nine regions divided by lines of value x. In the top left region is the finished structure and in some of the other there is the same structure but unfinished (could even be a blank region). Now copy the input and finish all structures using the value x which divides the regions. Dimension: The output dimension is the same dimension as used in the input. Values: All values used in the output will be already seen in the input. Changed values: Change the values which are in a region of an unfinished structure which is missing to have a finished structure.
1f0c79e5;Copy the input there will be a connected non-zero structure. If there is a 2 in the non-zero structure extend the square into that direction until you reach the boundaries of the dimension. Dimension: Output-dim is the same as the input-dim. Values: The output will only use non-zero values which have been seen in the input except for 2. Changed values: Change the values in the direction of the 2 value of the square.
1f642eb9;Copy the input and detect the connected non-zero structure with value 8 and the other freely distributed non-zero values at the edge of the input. Now change for each non-zero value on the edge the nearest 8 value in the detected structure to this value. Dimension: The output-dim is the same as the input-dim. Values: All used values in the output will be seen in the input. Changed values: Change the values of the structure having 8s being nearest to the freely distributed non-zero value on the edge of the input.
1f85a75f;In the input there are some random freely distributed non-zero values and one connected structure of uniform non-zero values nowhere else found in the input. The output is exactly this uniformly valued structure. Create the dim such that this structure fits perfectly into that rectangle. Dimension: The output dimension depends on the uniformly connected structure. Values: The only used values in the output will be zero and the one used by the uniformly value structure. Changed values: Values aren't changed the uniformly valued structure is only just copied.
1f876c06;Copy the input and connect each equal value pair diagonally. Dimension: The output-dim is the same as the input-dim. Values: All values used in the output are already seen in the input. Changed values: The values to be changed are the zero values are lying on the diagonal line of two equal values.
1fad071e;Just count the amount of 2x2 squares filled with value 1 and then create a 1x5 grid and insert from left to right as many one values as you counted 2x2 grids earlier the rest of the output grid is filled with 0s. Dimension: The output dimension is 1x5. Values: The possible values in the output are 0 and 1. Changed values: In the output grid from left to right change the values to 1 for as many entries as counted 2x2 grids filled with 1s.
2013d3e2;There is connected non-zero structure in the input. Detect the top left 3x3 part of the structure such that the top left corner of the structure is the middle entry of the 3x3 grid. Copy that grid and use it as output. Dimension: The output dimension is therefore 3x3. Values: The used values in the output depend on the values of the top left corner of the structure where the top left entry of the structure is the middle part of the 3x3 grid. Changed values: Changing of values is not needed since it is just a question of copying and cutting off from the input.
2204b7a8;Copy the input and detect the two solid lines, they can either be on the left and right edges or top and bottom edges. Lets assume one line has uniformely the value x and the other has uniformely the value y. Between these two lines there are freely distirbuted 3s. Now change each 3 to the value of the line nearest to it. Thats will give you the output. Dimension: The output dimension is the same as the input dimension. Values: The final values in the output will only be 0, x, and y. Changed values: Change the values of all entries being 3 in the input.
22233c11;Copy the input and observe the structure of the diagonally neighboring squares filled with 3s. Then add the same structure but with 8s such that they are lying on diagonal going through the contact point of the two structures filled with 3s. Notice that the added structure has to fit two time into that diagonal of zero values, so don't insert them too close to the original structure. If the added structures don't fully fit into the dimensions from the copied input just insert as much as possible without breaking the rules and extending the output dimensions. Dimension: The output-dim is the same as the input-dim. Values: The used values will be 0,3, and 8. Changed values: Change the zero values being in a position in which the added 8 structure should be such that the rule is followed.
2281f1f4;Copy the input and detect the non-zero values on the edges. Imagine from each value on the top a vertical line and from each non-zero value on the right imagine a horizontal line. Then turn each value where one of these imaginary lines crosses to 2. Dimension: The output-dim is equal to the input-dim since the input is only copied and then zero value within this grid are changed. Values: All used values in the output either are 0,2, and 5. Changed values: First imagine the lines explained earlier then observe where these imaginary lines would cross. These positions will be changed from 0 to 2.
228f6490;First copy the input then look for the structure with value 5. They have surrounded 0 values. Then detect the connected non-zero values in the rest of the input and once one structure is detected which matches the structure of the surrounded zero-values change them into the value of the freshly found structure and zero out the values outside of the 5s. Do that for all connected non-zero structures until there are non 0 values surrounded by 5s anymore then stop modifiying the copied input. Dimension: The output-dim is the same as the input-dim. Values: All values used in the output have been already seen in the input. Changed values: Change only the zero values surrounded by fives to the value of the fitting structure and once such a fitting structure is inserted into the frame built by 5s zero out this structure outside of the 5s.
22eb0ac0;First copy the input then detect the rows where two matching values are on each end of the row. Fill the space between the two matching values with the value the boundaries have.

Dimension: Choose the dimension such that the resulting line perfectly fits into the created grid. Values: Only use 0 and the non-five values seen in the input. Changed values: Values are not changed since the output is built from the ground up.
239be575;There two 2x2 grids with value 2 in the input. If they are connected by any path of non-zero values then the output is a 1x1 grid with value 8. If not then the value is a 1x1 grid with value 0. Dimension: The output dimension is 1x1. Values: The used output value is either 0 or 8. Changed values: Not applicable in this case.

Then there are the framed regions with unifrom values x and single exceptions y. Also there is connected non-zero structure in differing from the base value and not in one of these uniform regions, memorize this structure and delete it by turning all its values to the base value. Now for each trigger with value y in the region having value x apply the structure to it and extend the two line going away from the trigger until the boundaries of the region are reached. Dimension: Since the copied input is not changed in its dimensions the output-dim is the same as the input-dim.

If such a case if found turn each 0 value between them to 3. Do that for all found cases. Dimension: Since following the rule explained the input is copied and only values are changed then output-dim is the same as the input-dim. Values: The used values of the output are therefore all seen in the input except for the 3 this is the only newly used value. Changed values: Following the rule only change zero values being between 2 and 8 where 2 and 8 have to be on the edge of the grid.
2c608aff;Copy the input then detect that there is one base value which uniformely surrounds all other structures and.

2dd70a9a;Copy the input and then start from the values equal to three and try to find a path to the values of 2 by just changing values in a straight line to the value of three. You are only allowed to decide a new direction when you encounter an 8 while going along the straight path explained in the sentence before. At the end only change the shortest path found to values of three and keep the rest as has been in the input. Dimension: The output-dim is therefore the same as the input-dim.

3345333e;There is one connected non-zero structure in the input but it is destorted by a uniformly values rectangle.

Do exactly that such that none of the existing non-zero values have to be changed and they seemingly are used to be part of the newly built structures. Also if the freely distributed 2s are a 2x2 structure then double the size of the built structure if they are 3x3 triple the size of the structure etc. Values: All values used in the output have been seen in the input already. Changed values: Change the 0s being in the positions the new structures are built such that the original structure is rightly represented.

484b58aa;Copy the input and then turn each zero value into a non-zero value such that the indicated pattern is fulfilled again. To do that look for each zero value into environments of the input which look similar and then change the zero value in such a manner that stays in line with pattern and the region looking similar to the zero value. Dimension: The output-dim matches the input-dim since the input is copied and then just changed value-wise. Values: All values used in the output have been seen in the input already.

49d1d64f;Each value in a corner of the input will be an arrow with the same value shaped towards the middle of the grid in the output. Each value in a row or column which is not in a corner in the input and also is not in the perfect middle of the input will be a 2 entry long line with the respective value in the output. Each value in the input being exactly in the middle of the input will be just the value perfectly in the middle of the output. Dimension: Exceed the input dimension such that exactly the named rules can be applied to the input and the result perfectly fits into the grid. Values: All used values in the output have been seen in the input already.

4be741c5;Look at the input, there are several regions of uniformly connected non-zero regions. For each different non-zero value across these regions turn one value in the input into that value. Also note how they are aligned, meaning are the regions splitted from top to bottom or from left to right roughly speaking. Depending on the alignment the output will have different dimensions. Dimension: The output-dim depends on the alignment and the amoung of regions in the input. E.g. if there are three differently valued regions aligned from top to bottom the output will have dimensions 3x1. If there 4 differently valued regions from left to right the output will have dimensions 1x4. Values: All values used in the output have been seen in the input already.

Changed values: All inner values of the copied rectangled will be changed until they are all 8.
5117e062;In the input are many connected non-zero structures but only one have them has incorporated an 8. Copy this structure incorporating an 8 but turn the 8 into value used for the rest of the structure, then use this new structure as output. Choose the dimension such that the constructed structure fits exactly into that grid. Dimension: The output dimension is chosen such that the copied structure fits perfectly into it.

Changed values: Change the zero values added by extending the grid into the continued structure as described above.
543a7ed5;Copy the input and then put a frame of 3s around each connected structure of 6s. Then look for 8s being surrounded by 6s, if some are found turn these eights into 4s. Dimension: The output-dim matches the input-dim. Changed values: Changed 8s which are direct neighbors of 6s.

54d9e175;First copy the input and look at it like sections divided by 5s. Turn all values in a section into uniform values based on the following rules: 1->6, 2->7,3->8, and 4->9. This gives the final output. Dimension: The output-dim matches the input-dim since it is only copied and changed on a value basis. Values: As described the 5s stay the same but all other values transition as described earlier. Changed values: Each section of the copied input changes its values completely. 
5521c0d9;Copy the input and then shift each connected non-zero structure above the bottom by the amount of entries it is high. E.g. if a structure has a height of two there should be two zero values between the bottom of the shifted structure and the bottom of the grid. Dimension: The input-dim matches the output-dim. Values: All values used in the output have been seen in the input already. Changed values: Change the values above the structures such that the effect of shifting them up appears. Also change the values where they were earlier to 0 such that the space between the structure and the bottom of the grid is created.

Dimensions: The input matrix is 9 by 9 and the output matrix is 3 by 3. Values: the grouped numbers in the input matrix have values ranging from 1 to 9 except 5 and the individually present number has the value 5. Changed Values: The value 5 is removed and replaced with a 0 or a value whose group it was a part of
56dc2b01;reasoning: The input matrix consists of 2 sets of numbers represented by values 2 and 3 and the output is produced by appending both sets of values together and adding another row of value 8. The output is formed in such a way that the position of row containing 2s are fixed and the group of 3s is sandwiched between the value 8 and 2, where the value 8 is added in the output matrix.

5ad4f10b;reasoning: Observe the input matrix , it consists of 2 sets of non-zero values. one non zero value is spread across the matrix without a specific structure and the other non zero value is present in a structured format and takes a well defined shape. In the output matrix, values have to be transformed such that the well defined shape has to be maintained as it was present for the non-zero value but the non-zero number it takes would change to the number that was present throughout the matrix in an unstructured way.

5daaa586;reasoning: Consider the input matrix, which contains 2 rows and 2 columns where all entries have the same non-zero value across the entire row or column. These rows and columns form a border in the input matrix. This border, along with its values, is directly copied to the output matrix. Inside this border, the values in the output matrix depend on the corresponding values in the input matrix. Thus, the output matrix has 4 bordering rows and columns with distinct non-zero values. Now, examine the non-zero value within the inner region of the matrix. Identify which border value it aligns with and connect this border to the matching value. Along this path, each cell leading to the target cell is sequentially numbered.

60b61512;reasoning:The input matrix contains two distinct shapes, each made up of the same number (4 in this case), positioned at different locations within the matrix. To construct the output matrix, the input matrix is copied directly, and then the value 7 is added to select cells to transform these two separate shapes into a unified 9 by 9 square. Dimensions: the input and output dimensions of the matrices are same. Values: There are zeros and another non zero value - 4 which is present in 2 shapes across the input matrix. Changed Values: The value 7 is added to the existing matrix to form the shapes into a square
6150a2bd;reasoning: The input matrix is transformed through a diagonal inversion, where elements shift positions symmetrically. For instance, the value at (1,1) moves to (9,9) and vice versa. Similarly, the value at (1,2) shifts to (3,2) and vice versa, while the value at (1,3) moves to (3,1) and vice versa, continuing this pattern throughout the matrix.

Changed Values: The same non zero value is extended to all directions diagonally throughout the matrix replacing the zeros
62c24649;reasoning: The input is a 3 by 3 matrix, and the output matrix is constructed by creating four copies of this original matrix, each altered and positioned in a specific way to form a larger composite matrix. The first copy is placed in the top-left corner exactly as it appears in the input. The second copy is a horizontally mirrored version of the original matrix, positioned directly to the right of the first. The third copy is modified by reversing the first and third rows of the original matrix, and it is placed below the first copy. Finally, the fourth copy is a diagonally inverted version of the original matrix and is placed diagonally from the first copy. This arrangement of four distinct versions of the input matrix creates the final output matrix. Dimension: The input matrix is 3 by 3 and the output matrix is 6 by 6. Values: Values ranging from 0-9 are present in all the cells, however they are not significant for reasoning.
6430c8c4;reasoning: The input matrix is divided into two equal segments by a row of non-zero values, with each segment being 4 by 4 in size. Compare these two segments and identify the positions where both corresponding cells contain a 0. In the output matrix, which matches the dimensions of each segment, place a non-zero value (3 in this case) at each location where both segments have a zero. All other cells in the output matrix will contain a 0. Dimension: Input matrix has the dimension: 9 by 4 and the Output matrix has the dimension 4 by 4. Values: There are 3 non zero values used in the input matrix, one number each used in each segment and one number used to form the row to differentiate the two segments. Changed Values: The output matrix has only one non zero value ( 3 in this case) and rest are zeros
6455b5f5;"reasoning: The input matrix contains a single non-zero value, with the rest of the cells being zeros. This non-zero value is arranged in horizontal and vertical lines, creating rectangles of various sizes within the matrix. To construct the output matrix, first copy the input matrix as it is. Then, identify the largest rectangle formed by the non-zero values and fill it with 1s. Next, locate the smallest rectangle(s); if there are multiple smallest rectangles, fill all of them with 8s. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions are the same. Values: There is only one non zero value which is 2 and rest are zeros. Changed Values: The largest rectangle is filled with 1s and the smallest ones are filled with 8s (earlier they were zeros)"
662c240a;"reasoning: The input matrix includes three 3x3 submatrices, one of which will be selected as the output matrix. The selection follows a priority order based on specific values within the submatrices. The highest priority is given to the matrix containing the value 4; if a matrix has a 4, it will be chosen as the output. If no matrix contains a 4, the next priority goes to a matrix with the value 8. If neither 4 nor 8 is found, then the matrix containing either 6 or 3 will be selected, with these values sharing the third level of priority. Dimensions: The input dimension is 9 by 3. The output dimension is 3 by 3. Values: Input matrix contains values ranging from 1-9. Changed Values: No values are changed, but the entire matrix that matches the criteria is picked"
67385a82;"reasoning: The input matrix contains a non-zero value distributed throughout, while the remaining entries are zeros. The non-zero values exhibit a specific pattern; if they are adjacent either horizontally or vertically, we consider them connected. In the output matrix, the values in the connected cells are substituted with another non-zero value (8 in this instance), while the isolated values that are not connected retain their original value (3 in this case). Dimensions: The input and output matrices have the same dimension. Values: There is only one non zero value which is 3 spread across the input matrix. Changed Values: Some of the 3s are replaced with the value 8 and other continue to have 3"
673ef223;reasoning: Let閳ユ獨 break down the input matrix into two sections: the upper segment and the lower segment. The upper segment has an extra value of 8, along with a row of 2s in both segments. For the output matrix, first focus on the upper segment. Look at where the value 8 is located, then connect the 2 in the same row to the 8 and add a 4 to that row. Now, in the lower segment, if the 3rd row of 2s is connected to the 8 from the upper segment, take the 3rd row of 2s in the lower segment and replace the other values in that row with 8s. Dimension: Both the input and output matrices have the same dimension.
6773b310;reasoning: The input matrix is organized into 9 squares, each containing 9 cells filled with zeros and one cell holding the value of 6.

The output matrix consists of only 9 cells, with each cell representing one of the squares from the input matrix. If there is only one value of 6 in a square, the corresponding cell in the output matrix will be 0. However, if there are two values of 6 within the same square, that cell in the output matrix will be 1. Dimension: The input matrix is 11 by 11 and the output matrix is 3 by 3.

Changed Values: The Output matrix contains only 1s and 0s
67a3c6ac;reasoning: The input matrix includes values from 1 to 9, and the output matrix is created by transforming the input matrix as follows: the first column is moved to the last position, and the last column to the first position.

Similarly, the third column becomes the third-last column, and this pattern continues for the remaining columns. Dimensions: The input and the output dimensions remain the same.
67a423a3;reasoning: The input matrix includes a row and a column filled with non-zero values that intersect at a specific cell. This structure is copied directly to the output matrix.

Dimensions: The input and output matrices are of the same dimension. Values: There is a row and a column containing non zero values. Changed Values: 8 cells with value 4 are added around the intersection point of the row and column
67e8384a;reasoning: The input is a 3 by 3 matrix, and the output matrix is constructed by creating four copies of this original matrix, each altered and positioned in a specific way to form a larger composite matrix. The first copy is placed in the top-left corner exactly as it appears in the input. The second copy is a horizontally mirrored version of the original matrix, positioned directly to the right of the first. The third copy is modified by reversing the first and third rows of the original matrix, and it is placed below the first copy. Finally, the fourth copy is a diagonally inverted version of the original matrix and is placed diagonally from the first copy. This arrangement of four distinct versions of the input matrix creates the final output matrix. Dimension: The input matrix is 3 by 3 and the output matrix is 6 by 6. Values: Values ranging from 0-9 are present in all the cells, however they are not significant for reasoning.
681b3aeb;reasoning: The input matrix contains two groups of non-zero numbers located in different areas. These groups share a common feature: when combined, they always form a 3x3 square. Therefore, the two groups in the input matrix need to be merged to create a 3x3 square, which becomes the output matrix. Dimensions: The input matrix is 10 by 10 whereas the output matrix is 3 by 3. Values: There are 2 non zero values clustered in separate locations in the input matrix. Changed Values: There are no new values introduced, the existing set of values is combined
6855a6e4;reasoning: In the input matrix, values are arranged so that the value 2 forms a square bracket shape, [ ]. Another non-zero value (5, in this case) is positioned outside these brackets. In the output matrix, the square brackets made by the 2s are copied as they are, but the 5s are moved inside the square brackets. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions are the same. Values: The value 2 is used to create the shape of the square brackets and the value 5 is considered and brought inside the square brackets. Changed Values: There are no changed values.
68b16354;reasoning: The input matrix contains values from 1 to 9, and the output matrix is created by reversing the order of the rows: the first row is swapped with the last row, the second row with the second-last row, and so on. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions remain the same. Values: numbers ranging from 1-9 are used however the numbers do not play a significant role in reasoning, the row numbers are more significant for this example
694f12f3;reasoning: The input matrix contains only one non zero value (4 in this case). The cells containing the value 4 are structured in a way that they are present in the form of 2 rectangles, one is bigger than the other in terms of size. The output is strucutured in a way that the samller rectangle is filled with 1s and the larger rectangle is filled with 2s. However the outer border values of the 2 rectangles continue to have the value 4, the internal values of the rectangles are changed to 1s and 2s. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions are same. Values: The input matrix contains only one non zero value and it is structured in the form of 2 rectangles. Changed Values: The values inside the rectangle are changed from 4 to 1s and 2s depending on the size of the rectangle. The bigger triangle is filled with 2s and the smaller one is filled with 1s
6a1e5592;"reasoning: The input matrix has two groups of non-zero values: one at the top and another at the bottom. The shapes in the bottom are designed to fit specific areas in the top section. There are 3 or 4 possible spots in the top where these bottom shapes can connect, but the order of the shapes in the bottom does not matter; each shape is placed where it best fits. For example, a shape that appears first in the bottom might connect to the third spot in the top if it aligns well there. In the output matrix, the top half remains unchanged, and the shapes from the bottom are joined to the top, but the values of these bottom shapes change from 5 to 1 when they are connected. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions remain the same. Values: the two sets of non zero values are 2 and 5. 2 at the top and 5 at the bottom. Changed Values: The values containing 5 are chnaged to 1 in the output matrix"
6aa20dc0;reasoning: The input matrix contains a pattern involving at least three distinct values grouped together. In other areas of the matrix, these same values also appear individually in different locations. The pattern formed by the three distinct values should be replicated in these other areas where each of these values appears alone. While the pattern remains consistent, the number of cells it occupies will vary depending on the size of each area where the single values are located. Dimnesions: The input and output dimensions remain the same. Values: Instead of zeros the background values are non-zero values, and 3 distinct values that appear together are different from the background value. Changed Values: No new values are added but the pattern is studied and the same values are repeated in patterns
6b9890af;reasoning: In the input matrix, a square is formed using the value 2, with another non-zero value located outside this square. The output matrix is structured based on the dimensions of the square in the input matrix. The value outside the square is moved inside, expanding in size to fill and cover the entire area of the square, while maintaining the shape as observed in the input matrix. Dimensions: The output dimensions are defined by the square defined in the input matrix. Values: The square is formed by a non zero value (2 in this case) and there is another non zero value which is present outside the square. Changed Values: There are no new values introduced, the size of the shape containing the value that has to brought inside the square might be increased such that the entire square is covered by the pattern
6c434453;reasoning: The input matrix contains a single non-zero value (1 in this case) arranged in various shapes throughout the matrix. Any shape where the 1s form a 3x3 square with a 0 at the center is transformed in the output matrix into a cross shape, with both the length and width of the cross spanning 3 cells. Additionally, the value of this cross shape is changed from 1 to 2 in the output matrix. Dimension: The input and output matrices have the same dimension. Values: 1 is the only non-zero value. Changed Values: 1 is replaced by 2 where the a square shape is observed and it is transformed into a cross
6cdd2623;"reasoning:The input matrix has various non-zero values distributed throughout. Determine which non-zero value occurs the least frequently; this value will be the only one included in the output matrix. In the output matrix, connect these values by filling the corresponding rows or columns with the same value, ensuring it spans entire rows or columns where it appears. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions remain the same. Values: The input matrix contain many non zero values. Changed Values: Only the least frequent non zero value is kept all the other non zero values are not considered"
6cf79266;reasoning: The input matrix consists of a non-zero value along with zeros. Areas where the zeros form a 3x3 square are identified, and in the output matrix, these zero values are changed to 1. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions are same. Values: There is one non zero value and other are zeros. Changed Values: Instances where 0s form a 3 by 3 square are considered and those values are changed from 0 to 1, rest of the matrix remains the same
6d0160f0;reasoning: The input matrix contains rows and columns filled with 5s in such a way that it forms 9 matrices of dimension 3 by 3 each. Only one of the matrices contains a cell which has the value 4. That particular matrix is picked and placed in the trasnposed location in the output matrix which would contain the 5s which divides the matrix into 9 matrices but it wouldn't contain other non zero values in other matrices
6d0aefbc;reasoning: The input matrix, which has dimensions of 3 by 3, is duplicated, and the two copies are merged. In the second copy, the first column is swapped with the third column and vice versa. Dimesnions: The input dimension is 3 by 3 and the output dimension is 3 by 6. values: The values are not significant for reasoning. Changed Values: No values are changed, just the first and 3rd columns are swapped in the second copy while they are being merged
6d58a25d;reasoning: The input matrix contains two non-zero values: one is arranged in the shape of a hut or a triangle without a base, while the other value appears scattered throughout the matrix without any specific pattern. The output matrix is created by first copying the input matrix as is. Then, for each instance of the individual value, if it is located directly below the hut shape (in the same column), that entire column閳ユ攩rom the hut downwards閳ユ攰s filled with the individual value. Dimensions: The input and the output matrices have the same dimension. Values: There are two sets of non-zero values present. Changed Values: No new values are introduced, some zeros are changed to one of the non-zero entries based on the reasoning
6d75e8bb;reasoning: The input matrix contains only one non-zero value (8, in this case), which is grouped together but not arranged in a well-defined shape. The output matrix is created by copying the input matrix as is and then adding another non-zero value (2, in this case) to the cells such that adding the value 2 would transform the shape into a rectangle. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions are the same. Values: There is only one non zero value in the input matrix. Changed Values: some zeros are converted to 2 to form a rectangle
6e02f1e3;reasoning: The input matrix is a 3 by 3 matrix. When examining the rows, if the first row contains the same value in all three cells while the other two rows have different values, the output matrix will also be a 3 by 3 matrix with the value 5 placed on the upward diagonal at positions (1,3), (2,2), and (3,1). If, in addition to the first row, the third row also has the same value in all three cells (which can differ from the first row), the diagonal values in the output matrix will then point downward, starting from (1,1) to (3,3). In a different scenario where all rows are identical (meaning the entire input matrix contains the same value), the output matrix will feature the non-zero value only in the first row. In this case, the non-zero value is 5, which is used for the output matrix. Dimension: Both input and output dimensions are 3 by 3. Values: Input matrix can have any value Changed Values: The output matrix only has the value 5 or 0 depending on the reasoning
6e19193c;reasoning: The input matrix contains one non-zero value that consistently appears in sets of 3, forming a pattern that would resemble a square if the fourth cell were also filled with that value. In the output matrix, the input is copied as is, and the cell that is missing the non-zero value to complete the square is identified but left unchanged. The cells that lie diagonally from this missing cell are then updated, changing their values from 0 to the non-zero value. This diagonal line extends to the edge of the matrix. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions are the same. Vales: The input matrix has one non zero value in sets of 3 at different places in the matrix Changed Values: Some 0s are changed to the non zero value depending on the reasoning
6e82a1ae;reasoning: In the input matrix, a single non-zero value appears in clusters of either 2, 3, or 4 adjacent cells. The transformation process involves updating these clusters based on their size: clusters of 4 cells are replaced with the value 1, clusters of 3 cells are replaced with the value 2, and clusters of 2 cells are replaced with the value 3. This results in an output matrix where the original groups are simplified to reflect their specific cluster sizes. Dimension: Both the input and output matrices have the same dimensions. Values: Input Matrix has values 5 as the only non zero number. Changed Values: Output matrix has values 1,2 and 3. They have replaced the value 5 
6ecd11f4;reasoning: In the input matrix, we have two sets of numbers. Think of the larger set as a matrix, where cells with a 0 should stay 0 in the output matrix. For cells with non-zero values, use the corresponding values from the smaller set to replace these non-zero cells in the output. This means the output matrix will have the same shape as the larger set, keeping 0s in the same places, while non-zero values are replaced by the matching values from the smaller set. Dimension: The out put dimension is dependent on the size of the bigger set in the input matrix. Values: The bigger set has a non zero value and the samller set has numbers ranging from 1 to 9. Changed Values: The corresponding numbers from the smaller set are used to replace the non zero value in the larger set 
6f8cd79b;reasoning: The input matrix is filled entirely with 0s. In the output matrix, however, the first row, last row, first column, and last column are replaced with the number 8. This creates the appearance of a border of 8s surrounding a matrix filled with 0s. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions are the same. Values: The input matrix contains ony 0s. Changes Values: Some 0s are replaced with the value 8 according to the reasoning mentioned earlier
6fa7a44f;reasoning: The input matrix is duplicated, creating two identical copies. In the second copy, the first and third rows are swapped. This modified copy is then placed directly below the original matrix, resulting in the output matrix. Dimensions: The input dimension is 3 by 3 and the output dimension is 6 by 3 ( 6 rows and 3 columns). Values: Values do not play a significant role in reasoning, the matrix is copied and the rows are swapped irrespective of the value
72322fa7;reasoning: The input matrix contains fully-formed shapes, such as crosses, along with partial shapes that could be as small as a single cell. These partial shapes share the same values as their corresponding full shapes. In the output matrix, the original shapes remain as they are, while the partial shapes are completed to match the full cross shape. Dimensions: Input and Output dimensions are the same. Values: non-zero values that form the sahpes are studied, they can be any numbers from 1-9. Changed Values: Some 0 values are replaced with non zero values to complete the pattern
72ca375d;reasoning: The input matrix has 3 shapes, the output matrix is just one of the shapes. Of the 3 shapes the shape that is selected is either a square or a shape that has 4 cells connected to each other in a single row. If the input matrix contains 2 such shapes then the square will be picked. Dimensions: The input can be of any dimension, the output matrix has the dimensions of one of the shapes of the matrix. Values: The input matrix contains 3 sets of non-zero values. Chnaged Values: There are no changed values, the output matrix contains one of the shapes
73251a56;reasoning: The input matrix contains a pattern that is formed by non-zero values. However there are certain patches of zero values that mess up the underlying pattern, so the output matrix contains the underlying pattern as it is and the zeros are removed and replaced with non-zero values that complete the pattern. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions are same. Values: The input matrix contains values from 1-9 that form a certain pattern and there are zero values that act as a filter on top of the present pattern. Changed Values: The zeros are replaced with non zero values
7447852a;reasoning: The input matrix contains one non-zero number arranged in a repeating pattern of upright and inverted triangles. To create the output matrix, start with the first triangle (a half-triangle in each case) and replace its zero values with 4. Leave the next two triangles閳ユ攼ne upright and one inverted閳ユ敆nchanged. Then, fill the following inverted triangle with 4. Continue this pattern, leaving two triangles as they are and filling the third one with 4. Even if the pattern ends with only half of a triangle, fill that half with 4 as well. Dimensions: The input and output matrices would have the same dimensions. Values: The input matrix has only one non zero value which is 2. Changed Values: Some zeros are replaced with 4 as explained in the reasoning
7468f01a;reasoning:The input matrix contains a rectangle filled with two different non-zero values. The more abundant non-zero value acts as the background, while the other non-zero value is mirrored laterally. In the output matrix, the zero values are not considered it is the entire rectangle which is filled with non-zero values, but the less common value is flipped horizontally, as though the background value acts like a mirror. For instance, if the value 2 appears at position (2,2) in a 4x8 rectangle, in the output it will be placed at (2,6). Dimensions: The input can be of any dimension but the output dimension would be the same as the dimension of the rectangle present in the input matrix. Values: The input matrix contains a rectangle with 2 sets of non zero values. Changed Values: As lateral inversion takes place, some digits are changed according to the reasoning 
746b3537;reasoning: The input matrix has identical values either across entire rows or entire columns. If the values are the same across rows, the output will be a single column listing each unique value from those rows, with duplicates appearing only once. If the values are the same across columns, the output will be a single row containing each unique value from the first row of the input. Dimension: The input can be of any dimension, but the output would either be just one row or one column depending on the values. Values: The input matrix contains values from 1-9 and are equal either across the row or columns. Changed Values: No values are changed, only the unique values that occur in the input matrix are presented in the form of a row or a column
74dd1130;reasoning: The input matrix is 3 by 3 and contains values from 1-9. The output matrix is formed by taking the transpose of the input matrix. Dimensions: Both input and output matrices have the dimension 3 by 3. Values: Values do not play a significant rle in reasoning as just the transpose is taken of the input matrix
75b8110e;"reasoning: The input matrix consists of four distinct sets of non-zero values閳?, 5, 6, and 9閳ユ攣nd is divided into four 4x4 submatrices, each containing only one of these values as its non-zero elements. The objective is to create a 4x4 output matrix by assigning each cell based on a specific order of priority. The highest priority is given to the submatrix with the value 5; if a cell contains a 5, that value is directly placed in the corresponding position in the output matrix. For any cell where the matrix with 5s has a 0, the matrix containing the value 6 is checked next, and any 6 in that position is assigned to the output. If neither 5 nor 6 is found in a cell, the process continues with the matrix containing 9s, followed by the matrix with 4s as the last priority. By following this order, each cell in the output matrix is filled according to the hierarchy of values from the input submatrices. Dimensions: Input dimension: 8 by 8. Output Dimension: 4 by 4. Values: Input matrix contains 4 sets of non zero values. Changed Values: No values are changed, they are compared and picked based on the reasoning"
760b3cac;reasoning: The input matrix contains two sets of non-zero values, 8 and 4, each arranged in 3x3 square regions. In the 4-region, every example follows a common pattern: values are present in the second row and in cell (3,2) of the 3x3 square (relative to the square, not the entire matrix). The variation depends on whether the value 4 is positioned at (1,1) (left side) or (1,3) (right side) of the square. If the value 4 appears in cell (1,1), the 8-region is copied, flipped laterally, and placed to the left of the 4-region. If the value 4 is in cell (1,3), the flipped 8-region is placed to the right of the 4-region in the output matrix. Dimensions: Both input and output matrices have the same dimensions. Values: There are zeros and 2 regions where non zero values are present that is 8 and 4, Changed Values: Cells containing 0s are changed to 8 depending on the reasoning
776ffc46;reasoning: The input matrix contains various shapes, some enclosed within a border of 5s and others outside this boundary. The task is to examine the shapes within the borders and, if identical shapes are found outside the borders, replace the values of the corresponding external shapes with the value used to create the internal shape. If there are multiple shapes inside the borders, count the number of identical shapes for each outside the borders. If one internal shape has two corresponding shapes outside the borders and another has only one, prioritize the shape with two matches, updating the values for that shape accordingly. Dimensions: Both input and output matrices have the same dimension. Values: The input matrix has 2 sets of non zero values, one set is used for the values inside the borders and the other is used for shapes outside the borders. Changed Values: For the identified shapes, their values are updated from one non-zero value to another.
77fdfe62;reasoning: The input matrix has values of 1 arranged in a way that forms a square within the matrix, with four distinct non-zero values located at the four corners of the input matrix. The output matrix has the same dimensions as the square formed with the 1s. This square is divided into four equal parts: the top-left part is filled with the non-zero value from the top-left corner of the input matrix, and the other parts are similarly filled with the non-zero values from their respective corners. Only the non-zero cells within each section of the square are replaced with these corner values, while zero cells remain unchanged, creating the final output matrix. Dimensions: The input dimensions can vary however the output matrix has the dimension of the square matrix that was formed by the 1s inside the input matrix. Values: Distinct non zero values are present in the 4 corners of the input matrix and value 1 is presen tin the matrix such that it forms a border for the square matrix inside it, and the square matrix consisis of one non zero value which is 8 and other values are 0. Changed Values: Some Zeros inside the square matrix are changed to the respective non zero value as described in the reasoning
780d0b14;reasoning:The input matrix contains groups of non-zero values concentrated in distinct regions, each with a few zero values scattered within. However, each region is primarily defined by a single non-zero value, allowing each region to be represented by that one value. In the output matrix, each of these regions is condensed into a single cell with the value representing the entire region. If there are six distinct regions in the input matrix, the output matrix will have six cells, each holding the value of its respective region, arranged to reflect the regions閳?positions in the input matrix. Dimensions: dimension of the input matrix can vary and the output dimension would depend on the number of regions in the input matrix. Values: There would be sets of non-zero values present in different regions in the input matrix. Changed Values: No values are changed, the output matrix contains the non zero value that was present in different regions in the input matrix
7837ac64;reasoning: The input matrix has an abundant non-zero value arranged to form multiple small square matrices across it. Some of these squares have a different non-zero value located at their four corners, while others do not. In the output, form a 3x3 square matrix using these smaller squares. In this 3x3 output matrix, cells corresponding to squares without any corner values will be filled with 0s, while cells corresponding to squares that do have corner values will take on those values. Dimensions: The input dimensions can vary but Ouptut matrix would be 3 by 3. Values: Multiple non zero values exist. Changed Values: The output matrix contains a few non zero values and 0 values
794b24be;reasoning: Count the non-zero values in the input matrix and fill the output matrix accordingly: if there is 1 non-zero value in the input matrix, fill only 1 cell in the output matrix. If there are 2 non-zero values, fill the first 2 cells in the output matrix. If there are 4 non-zero values in the input matrix, then the 5th cell in the output matrix, specifically located at (2,2), will be filled with a different non-zero value. Continue this pattern for additional non-zero values as needed. Dimensions: The input and output matrices have the dimension 3 by 3. Values: 1 is the only non zero value present. Changed Value: The value 2 is used in the output matrix. 
7b6016b9;reasoning: The input matrix contains a single non-zero value that appears in various rows and columns, forming lines that create closed structures. In the output matrix, these closed structures are filled with the value 2, while the cells that form the lines retain their original value. All other cells that do not contribute to a closed structure are filled with the value 3. Dimensions: Both input and output matrices have the same dimensions. Values: Input matrix contains one non zero value in the form of lines. Changed Values: The cells contributing to a closed strucuture are replaced with 2 and the other cells that do not contribute are replaced with 3.
7b7f7511;reasoning: The input matrix features a pattern consisting of two identical matrices within it. The output matrix contains only one of these matrices, with the duplicate removed. Dimensions: The dimensions of teh input matrix depends on the matrix that is contained inside the input matrix. Values: Values do not play a significant role in reasoning, the two copies of the matrix are identified and that one matrix is the output
7c008303;reasoning: The input matrix contains the value 8 positioned in one row and one column, dividing the entire matrix into four sections, of which only two are significant. One section is a small 2x2 matrix located in one corner of the input matrix, while the other important section is a 6x6 square matrix. The output matrix consists solely of this 6x6 square, with the values inside positioned the same way as they were in the input matrix, but the values themselves change based on the 2x2 corner matrix. The value in cell (1,1) of the small matrix is used to fill the cells from (1,1) to (3,3) of the output, and similarly, other corresponding regions of the output matrix are filled with values from the smaller matrix, while their positions are determined by the layout of the larger 6x6 square. Dimensions: The input matrix is of the dimension 9 by 9 and the output dimension is 6 by 6. Values: Value 8 divides the matrix into different regions and square of 6 by 6 has the value 3 in different parts whereas the region with 2 by 2 square in the corner has 4 non zero values. Changed Values: The output contains the values present in the 2 by 2 square matrix
7ddcd7ec;reasoning: The input matrix contains a square of numbers and some corners contain an additional cell attached diagonally to the matrix, the output matrix contains the input matrix as it is and then the additional cells that were attached to the square amtrix are extended diagonally throughout the matrix in that one direction. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions remain the same. Values: There is one non zero value present in the matrix. Changed Values: some cells containing 0s are changed to the non zero number if they appear in the diagonal that is extended in that direction
7df24a62;reasoning: The input matrix features a region filled with 1s, with a few cells within that region containing the value 4. The arrangement of the 4s needs to be observed, and the entire input matrix should be scanned to identify if there are any other areas where the 4s appear in the same orientation. These identified regions will be filled with 1s, similar to the original region in the input matrix. While the pattern of the 4s must remain the same, it may be visually flipped either laterally or vertically. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions remain the same. Values: Input matrix contains values 1 in the region and the value 4 is scattered across the input matrix. Changed Values: some cells containing 0s are changed to 1 in those regions where the orientation of 4 matches
7e0986d6;reasoning: The input matrix features a non-zero value that appears abundantly in blocks, along with a few scattered non-zero values throughout the matrix. In the output matrix, the scattered values are removed, leaving only the contiguous blocks of regions that contain the original value. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions are the same. Values: One non zero value present in blocks, other non zero value scattered across the matrix. Changed Values: The scattered values are removed and replaced with either 0s or the block values that they appeared in
7f4411dc;reasoning: The input matrix features a non-zero value that appears abundantly in blocks, along with a few scattered values throughout the matrix. In the output matrix, the scattered values are removed, leaving only the contiguous blocks of regions that contain the original value. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions are the same. Values: One non zero value present in blocks and scattered across the matrix. Changed Values: The scattered values are removed and replaced with 0s
7fe24cdd;"reasoning: The input matrix is duplicated four times. The first copy is used as it is for the output. In the second copy, the first row becomes the third column, the second row becomes the second column, and the third row becomes the first column; this modified copy is placed to the right of the first matrix. The third copy is transformed by changing the first column to the third row, the second column to the second row, and the third column to the first row, and this copy is placed below the first copy. The fourth copy is altered by swapping the first and third rows and then flipping the matrix laterally; this copy is positioned below the second copy and next to the third copy. Finally, all these copies are combined to create the output matrix. Dimensions: The input dimension is 3 by 3 and output dimension is 6 by 6. Values: Values do not matter for reasoning, only rows and columns of the matrix are transformed as explained in the reasoning"
80af3007;reasoning: The input matrix contains a non-zero value arranged in a specific pattern. This pattern must be studied to create the output matrix, which includes only the region where the pattern exists in the input matrix. If the pattern consists of four blocks arranged in a particular configuration, then each of those four blocks will also be rearranged within themselves to maintain the same configuration. Dimension: The input dimension can vary and the output dimension depends on the region containing the pattern. Values: There is only one non zero value 5 used. Changed Values: Some calles containing 5s are changed to 0s for the patterns to match
810b9b61;reasoning: The input matrix consists of certain shapes formed by 1s. There are few shapes which are closed in nature and the others are open, the ones that are closed, their values are chnaged from 1 to 3 in the output whereas other shapes continue to have the same value. Dimensions: Both input and output dimensions are the same. Values: 1 was the only non zero value present in the form of shapes. Changed Values: 1 was changed to 3 for shapes where the structure was closed
83302e8f;reasoning: The input matrix features a non-zero number that appears in specific rows and columns, creating a grid-like appearance where the borders of each grid are formed by the lines made by the non-zero number. However, some border cells are missing the non-zero number, resulting in open grids. In the output matrix, all closed grids are filled with the value 3, while the open grids, which have a missing value, are filled with the value 4. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions are same. Values: In the input matrix, there is only one non zero value which is positioned to form grid like structures. Changed Values: 0s are changed to 3s and 4s depending on whether the grids formed are open or closed
834ec97d;reasoning: The input matrix contains a single non-zero value located in just one cell. This cell's position is noted, and the value is moved down one row and pasted into the output matrix. In the first row of the same column, the value 4 is filled into every cell above the newly placed non-zero value until reaching its original position. Next, the value of 4 is replicated in alternate columns on both sides of the current column. Therefore, one column will contain 0s, while the other columns will hold the value 4 only up to the row of the original non-zero value, meaning not all cells in those columns will be filled with 4s. Dimensions: Input and Output matrices would have the same dimension. Values: there is only one non zero value in the input matrix. Changed Values: Value 4 is introduced to replace the 0s in certain columns
8403a5d5;reasoning: The input matrix contains a non-zero value located in any cell of the bottom row. In the output matrix, the entire column where the non-zero value is found will be filled with that same value. This value will then be copied to alternate columns to the right of the current column (where the non-zero value was positioned in the input matrix). Between the columns with the non-zero values, the value 5 will be added, starting with the top cell of the first empty column, then placed in the bottom cell of the next empty column, followed by the top cell of the subsequent empty column, and so on. Dimensions: Input and Output dimensions would be the same. Values: Input matrix contains just one non zero value in one cell. Changed Values: 0s are changed to other non-zero numbers depending on the reasoning
846bdb03;reasoning: The input matrix contains two lines filled with a specific non-zero value, identifiable by a 4 at each end. These lines serve as a frame, within which another shape in the matrix should be enclosed in the output matrix. The number forming the frame lines will connect only with the same number in the other shape (e.g., 1 will connect with 1, and 3 will connect with 3). Thus, in the output matrix, the shape is enclosed by the frame, maintaining alignment of matching values. Dimensions: The output dimension depends on the frame created by the two lines. The output matrix would only contain the frame and the other shape within it. Values: The input matrix contains 2 non zero values and a 4. Changed Values: There are no changed values, the cells are rearranged as explained in the reasoning
855e0971;reasoning:The input matrix has several sections with non-zero values, so it can be divided into regions where these values are grouped across certain rows or columns. However, within these sections, there are a few isolated 0 values. To create the output matrix, start by copying the input matrix as it is. Then, for each 0 value, if it appears within a region spanning 4 rows (for instance) and is located in the second column of that region, then all 4 rows in that column will be filled with 0s. Similarly, if the region extends across columns, then each column in that row will be filled with 0s accordingly. Dimension: The input and output matrices have the same dimension. Values: non zero values are present in different sections of tehe input matrix. Changed Values: Certain non-zero values are changed to 0s depending on the reasoning
85c4e7cd;reasoning: The input matrix is organized with different values forming a series of nested borders, each enclosing the next, with a 2x2 square at the center. In the output matrix, the values are reordered such that the value from the innermost square now forms the outermost border, and so on, reversing the order in which the values originally appeared. Dimensions: The input and output matrices have the same dimension. Values: Different non zero values are used to create the borders changed values: there are no changed values, the present values are rearranged within the matrix
868de0fa;reasoning: In the input matrix, the value 1 forms square shapes. In the output matrix, these squares are filled with a non-zero value: 2 if the side length of the square is even, and 7 if the side length is odd. Dimensions: Both input and output dimensions are same. Values: Input matrix contains 1s and 0s Changed values: the celss within the squares are changed from 0s to 7 or 2 depending on the reasoning
8731374e;reasoning: The input matrix contains many non-zero values that act as noise, while a distinct non-zero value forms a rectangle near the center. Within this rectangle, there are a few isolated values. In the output matrix, only the rectangle is preserved, with each isolated value extended along its row and column. Dimensions: The output dimension depends on the rectwangle that was observed within the input matrix. Values: Input matrix contains a lot of noise with a rectangle filled with a particular non zero value and  a few isolated values within the rectangle. Changed Values: the values of the rectangle are altered depending on the isolated values along the rows and columns of the isolated value 
88a10436;reasoning: The input matrix contains a set of non zero values which are psoitioned together and an isolated value of 5 somewhere else, the output matrix is created in a way that the pattern that was observed for the set of non zero value sis copied as it is along with the value and replaced with the region which contained the isolated value of 5. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions are same. Values: There are non zero values in a group  and an isolated 5. changed values: the cell containing 5 is replaced with the same strucutre that is observed in one part of the matrix
88a62173;reasoning: The input matrix contains multiple copies of a 2x2 matrix placed equidistant from each other. Three of these copies are identical, while the fourth is different. The output matrix is simply the unique 2x2 matrix. Dimensions: The input matrix is 5 by 5 and the output matrix is 2 by 2. Values: Values do not play a significant role in reasoning as just the different copies are observed and the one that is unique is presented as the output matrix
890034e9;reasoning: The input matrix contains a predominant non-zero value that acts as the background and another non-zero value that forms a border around regions filled with zeros. In certain parts of the matrix, zeros appear in a similar arrangement, allowing for additional borders to be added around these areas, maintaining the exact orientation of the zeros as in the original. The output matrix includes the original matrix with borders added around other regions where the zeros match in arrangement. Dimensions: The input and output matrices have the same dimension. Values: the input matrix contains a non zero value as the background and another non zero value which acts as the border and zeros which are included in the border. Changed Values: The border values of other sections containing the same amount of zeros is changed to the non zero value that was observed for the first border
8a004b2b;reasoning: The input matrix contains 4 cells with the value 4, these 4 cells acts as borders, within which there is some pattern observed and outside the border there is another group of cells that is present. The output matrix would have the border cells as the 4 cells with the value 4 and within it, the shape that was observed outside the border in the input matrix is brought inside and scaled up to match the size of the original inner values. Dimensions: The output dimensions depend on the 4 border celss with the value 4 as they acts as border points for the output matrix.

8d5021e8;reasoning: The input matrix is duplicated to create six copies, each transformed and arranged to produce the final output matrix. The first copy has its first and third rows swapped, with all rows then mirrored laterally. The second copy also swaps its first and third rows but keeps the rows in their original orientation, and this copy is positioned to the right of the first.

The first matrix is populated with numbers, while the other two matrices consist entirely of 0s. To create the output matrix, the first matrix is copied exactly as it is. The second matrix is derived by taking the first column of the first matrix and using it as the first row of the second matrix, reversing its order in the process. Similarly, the second column of the first matrix becomes the second row of the second matrix, also in reverse order, and the same transformation is applied to the third column and third row. For the third matrix, the first and third rows of the first matrix are swapped, and then all elements of the third matrix are laterally inverted. Dimensions: The input and outputt dimensions remain the same. Values: Values do not play any significant role in reasoning, it is all about row transformations. Changed Values: Cells containing 0s are filled with non zero values depending on the reasoning
8eb1be9a;"reassoning:The input matrix features a pattern created using three rows. The output is generated by duplicating this pattern both above and below its current position throughout the matrix.

9172f3a0;reasoning: The input matrix is a 3 by 3 matrix, where each cell is subdivided into 9 smaller cells, preserving the original value from which they were derived. Consequently, the output matrix is a 9 by 9 matrix, as each of the original cells has been expanded into 9 cells. Dimensions: Input matrix is 3 by 3. Output matrix is 9 by 9.

93b581b8;reasoning: The input matrix consists of 4 cells filled with non-zero values arranged in a 2 by 2 square. This matrix is copied exactly into the output matrix, preserving the relative positions of the 4 values. The value located at (1,1) in the square generates its own 2 by 2 square, which is diagonally attached to the (2,2) cell of the original square. Similarly, the value at (2,2) creates another 2 by 2 square that is diagonally connected to the square at (1,1), and this process is repeated for the values at (1,2) and (2,1). If the edges of the matrix are reached and a full 2 by 2 square cannot be formed along any diagonal, the values should still be placed in the remaining cells, even if only 2 cells are left in a row or column. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions are same. Values: Input matrix contains a 2 by 2 square with non-zero values. Changed Values: The cells containing 0s are changed to the non-zero values based on the reasoning
941d9a10;reasoning: The input matrix consists of rows and columns filled with the value 5, creating a grid-like structure. The output matrix is generated by filling the grid located in the top left corner with 1s, the grid positioned in the center (that is, in the middle row and middle column) with the value 2, and the grid in the bottom right corner with the value 3.

94f9d214;reasoning: The input matrix can be divided into two sections, each filled with values of 1s and 3s, with each region measuring 4 by 4. The output matrix is generated by comparing each cell of the two segments. If both corresponding cells are empty, the output matrix at that position will contain the value 2. For any other combination, the output matrix will have a value of 0 in that cell. Dimensions: Input matrix has the dimension: 8 by 4 and the output matrix has the dimension 4 by 4. values: Input matrix has values 1s and 3s in two segments, Changed Values: There are no changed values, values are compared in both segments are value 2 is introduced if both corresponding cells have 0 value.
952a094c;reasoning: The input matrix contains a non-zero value forming a rectangular shape, with four distinct non-zero values located at each of the rectangle's corners. The output matrix is created by copying the rectangle as it is, and then positioning each corner value outside the rectangle in a diagonal manner: the value at the top right corner is placed diagonally outside the bottom left corner, the value at the top left corner is positioned diagonally outside the bottom right corner, and similarly for the remaining corners. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions are the same. Values: a non zero value forms an entire rectangle and there are 4 distinct non zero values attached to the corners of the rectangle.

9565186b;reasoning: The input matrix is a 3x3 grid containing various non-zero values. The most frequently occurring value within this matrix is identified and kept in its original positions. All remaining cells are then filled with the value 5. Dimensions: Both input and output matrices are of dimension 3 by 3. Values: Input matrix has the values in the range of 1-9. Changed Values: The Output matrix would contain values that occurred the most in the input matrix and the other cells would be filled up with the value 5.
963e52fc;reasoning: The input matrix contains a repeating pattern formed by non-zero values, and this pattern needs to be extended horizontally. In the output matrix, the pattern is repeated to double the number of columns in comparison to the input matrix, seamlessly continuing the sequence without merely duplicating the entire input matrix. This ensures that the pattern is extended in a consistent and aligned manner across the expanded matrix. Dimensions: The output matrix has double the number of input columns and same number of rows. Values: Values do not play a significant role in reasoning, the pattern is extended over the matrix
97a05b5b;reasoning: The input matrix contains a block of 2s with several empty cells (0s) forming specific shapes within it. Outside this block, there are shapes made of 2s that correspond to the empty spaces in the block of 2s. To complete the block, these external shapes need to be rotated and positioned so they fit into the holes, aligning their 2s with those already in the block. Dimensions: The output dimension depends on the block of 2s as that is the only matrix that is extracted as the output. Values: The input matrix contains a block of 2s with a few holes in it and there are other shapes outside the block which contain values ranging from 1-9. Changed Values: Some 2s in the block would be replaced by the other non-zero values as the shapes would be fit into holes and the 0s would be filled up by the 2s in the block.
98cf29f8;reasoning: The input matrix contains two blocks of non-zero values connected by a line, either in a row or a column, that shares one of the two block values. To create the output, the connecting line is removed, and the block with the same value as the line is shifted closer to the other block until they are adjacent. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions are same. Values: The input matrix contains 2 non zero numbers as blocks, Changed Values: Non-zero values of the line are removed, hence the values of one of the block is shifted closer to the other block
995c5fa3;reasoning: The input matrix is divided by two columns of 0s into three distinct 4x4 submatrices, each of which determines one row in the output matrix, containing three cells per row. The output matrix values for each row are defined based on the specific arrangement of 5s and 0s within these submatrices. If a submatrix consists entirely of 5s, the corresponding output row is filled with the value 2. When a submatrix has 5s everywhere except for a central 2x2 block of 0s, the output row is filled with the value 8. If a submatrix has 5s in all cells but has 0s specifically in the outer positions (2,1), (3,1), (2,4), and (3,4), the output row receives the value 3. Lastly, if a submatrix has 5s in all cells except for 0s positioned at (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), and (4,3) in a lower central area, the output row is filled with the value 4. Dimensions: Input matrices have the dimension 4 by 14 and the outhput matrix has the dimension 3 by 3. Values: The input matrix contains the values 0 and 5. Changed Values: There are no changed values, new values are determined based on the reasoning provided
99b1bc43;reasoning: The input matrix includes a row filled with the value 4, which divides the matrix into two 4x4 sections. Each cell in these two sections is compared, and specific conditions determine the value assigned to each cell in the output matrix. If a cell in the first section contains a 0 and the corresponding cell in the second section contains a 2, or if the cell in the first section contains a 1 and the corresponding cell in the second section contains a 0, then the output matrix cell will be assigned the value 3. In all other cases, the output matrix cell will be assigned the value 0. Dimensions: The input matrix is of the dimension 9 by 4. The output matrix is of the dimension 4 by 4. Values: The input matrix contains values 4 which divides the matrix into 2 parts, and the two parts are filled with 1s and 2s respectively along with a few 0 values. Changed Values: There are no changed values, vvalues in both the parts are compared and the value given iseither a 0 or a 3 based on the condition given in reasoning
99fa7670;reasoning: The input matrix contains isolated non-zero values. For each of these values, starting from the position of the isolated cell, the row is filled with that value to the right, continuing until the end of the row. After reaching the row閳ユ獨 end, the value fills downward until it reaches the bottom of the matrix. If there are multiple isolated values in different rows, both initially extend to the right in their respective rows and then fill downward. However, if a higher value encounters a lower value while filling downward, it stops at that cell. Only the lower isolated value will continue downward until the matrix閳ユ獨 bottom. Dimensions: Both input and output matrices would have the same dimension. Values: Input matrix contains isolated non zero values. Changed Values: some zeros are changed to the non-zero value based on the reasoning
9aec4887;reasoning: The input matrix contains 2 sets of values one is a shape made up by 8s and the other is a shape that resembles a box. The output matrix contains the box-like structure with the shape of 8s enclosed within it. Dimensions: The output dimension is dependent on the size of the box like structure as the other background zero values are not considered for the output matrix. Values: The input values contain a shape made of of 8s and a box like strucuture formed by non zero values. Changed Values: No values are changed but the cells are rearranged
9af7a82c;reasoning: The input matrix contains various non-zero values. The frequency of each non-zero value is counted, and the value that appears most frequently is placed in the first column, occupying a number of rows equal to its frequency in the input matrix. The second column is then filled with the second most frequent value, which also takes up as many rows as it was observed. Any remaining cells in the second column are filled with 0. This process is repeated for all non-zero values present in the input matrix. Dimensions: The input dimensions can vary and the output dimensions depend on the most frequent non-zero value and the number of distinct non-zero values that occur in the input matrix. Values: The input matrix contains values in range of 1-9. Changed Values: No values would be changed, they would be displayed in a different order
9d9215db;reasoning:The input matrix contains several isolated non-zero values. First, the value located in one of the corners is examined, and then the values in the same row and column as this corner value are noted. Using these two non-zero values, a square is constructed, ensuring that no values appear in the corresponding rows and columns, while maintaining the same spatial arrangement as the original corner values. If there is a one-cell gap between the two observed values, the square's border will also have a one-cell gap between its corresponding 1s, with the corner values remaining the same as those initially observed. In the input matrix, the first two values used to form the square are treated as corners. For example, if an 8 is at position (1,1) and a 1 is at (1,2) and (2,1), then the value at (2,2) must also be replicated under all four corners of the resulting square. If, upon examining the first corner value, say 3, there are no other values in the same row or column, then 3 will be placed in all four corners of the output square, and the process continues inward to identify the next value. If a corner value is found with another non-zero value in the same row and column, then the square will be constructed as described earlier, with 3 positioned outside the square. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions are same. Values: The input matrix contains a few non zero isolated values. Changed Values: Some cells containing 0s are chnaged to non-zero values based on the reasoning provided
9dfd6313;reasoning: The input matrix is transformed so that each column in the input becomes the corresponding row in the output matrix. For example, the first column of the input becomes the first row of the output, the second column becomes the second row, and so forth. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions remain the same. Values: Values do not affect the reasoning for this case, as the columns are transformed into rows irrespective of the values
9ecd008a;reasoning: The input matrix has numerous non-zero values scattered across it, along with a 3x3 block of cells filled with 0s. The matrix is symmetrically arranged about its center. To create the output matrix, identify the cells that are symmetrically opposite to the 3x3 block of 0s. Then, in the output matrix, place a laterally mirrored version of the values found in this opposite region. Dimensions: The input matrix is of dimension 16 by 16 and output matrix has dimension 3 by 3. Values: Input matrix has vlaues ranging from 1-9. Changed Values: There are no changed values, the matrix has to be loacated and has to be laterally inverted
9edfc990;"reasoning: The input matrix contains both non-zero and zero values dispersed across it. In the output, cells with 0 will remain 0 only if they are completely surrounded by other non-zero values, effectively blocking them off. However, if a 0 cell is not enclosed by non-zero values (and therefore has an opening), it will be replaced by 1. In this way, if we consider 1 as water, it ""flows"" into 0 cells that are not sealed off by surrounding non-zero cells. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions remain the same. Values: Input matrix contains values ranging from 1 to 9. Changed Values: The cells containing 0s are changed to 1 based on the reasoning"
9f236235;reasoning: The input matrix consists of a non-zero value distributed across rows and columns, forming a grid-like structure. Each grid section contains cells with the same value, so each grid can be represented by a single value. This allows us to think of each grid as a cell in a condensed matrix. To produce the output matrix, we take this conceptual matrix of grid values and apply a lateral inversion. Dimensions: The output matrix has the dimensions of the conceptual matrix formed by the grid like structures. Values: A non zero value is used to form grid like strucutures and then each grid contains certain values which can be 0-9. Changed Values: No values are changed, but the values that are present in the grids are represented in a square matrix
a1570a43;reasoning: The input matrix includes four cells with the value 3 that serve as border markers, with a shape made up of 2s located outside this bordered area. In the output matrix, the shape formed by 2s is repositioned to be centered within the border cells. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions are the same. Values: A shape is formed by 2s and there are 4 cells which contain the value 3. Changed Values: The cells containing 2s are repositioned such that they occur at the center of the border cells
a2fd1cf0;reasoning: The input matrix contains only two non-zero cells, one with a value of 2 and the other with a value of 3. The output matrix is created by connecting these cells using cells filled with the value 8. The connection is formed such that the cell containing 2 is linked horizontally (either left or right), while the cell containing 3 is connected vertically (either up or down). This line of 8s connects the two cells. Dimensions: The Input and output dimensions are the same. Values: Input matrix only contains 2 non zero values 2 and 3. Changed Values. Some cells containing 0s are changed to 8, they are used to connect the 2 cells containing 2 and 3.
a3325580;reasoning: The input matrix contains certain non-zero values grouped together. The frequency of each non-zero value is calculated, and the values with the highest frequency are displayed in columns in the output matrix. If multiple values share the highest frequency, they will be shown in adjacent columns, regardless of how many values meet this criterion. Dimensions: The dimension of the output matrix would depend on the frequency of the non zero values. Values: Input matrix would contain group of non-zero values. 
a3df8b1e;reasoning: The input matrix contains a value 1 in the bottom left corner. This is copied as it is in the output matrix and then 1 is added diagonally upwords from the bottom left cell. When the diagonal reaches the end of the matrix, the diagonal would continue towards the top left direction until the edge is reached, after which diagonal is continued towards top right and so on untile the top of the matrix is reached. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions remain the same. Values: The input matrix contains only one cell with a non-zero value with the value 1, Changed Values: The cells containing 0s are changed to 1 if they appear in the path of diagonals
a416b8f3;reasoning: The input matrix is taken and 2 copies of it are created and joined together side by side to produce the output matrix. Dimensions: The output matrix would contain same number of rows as the input matrix but double the number of columns as the input matrix. Values: Values do not play a significant role in the reasoning as the 2 copies are created and joined side by side
a48eeaf7;reasoning: The input matrix features a value of 2 in four cells arranged in a 2 by 2 square, alongside isolated cells containing the value 5. The output matrix is created by replicating the 2 by 2 square as it is and drawing the value 5 towards it, as if it were being attracted by a magnet. Consequently, the value 5 can either align with the diagonal of the 2s or attach to one of their sides, depending on which position is directly in line. Dimensions: Input and Output dimensions are same. Values: square matrix contains value 2 and isolated cells contain value 5. Changed Values: No values are changed, only the position of the cell containing 5 is changed as per the reasoning
a5313dff;reasoning:The input matrix contains the value 2 distributed across multiple rows and columns, forming both closed and open structures. All closed structures are examined, and any that include cells with the value 0 are filled with the value 1.

Dimensions: The input and output dimensions remain the same. Values: Input matrix contains the value 2 which forms closed and open structures. Changed Values: The cells within the closed structures that are 0s are changed to 1

Changed Values: The values along the diagonal are changed to 4 on alternate basis
a61ba2ce;reasoning: The input matrix consists of four groups of distinct non-zero values, with each group representing a corner of the output matrix. These four groups are merged to create the output matrix, which has four central cells filled with the value 0. Each corner group contains three values arranged in an L shape with three cells. Dimensions: The output dimension is 4 by 4. Values: The input matrix contains non zero values grouped together to form corners for the output matrix. Changed Values: No values are changed, values of the 4 groups are merged to form the output matrix
a61f2674;reasoning: The input matrix features the value 5 distributed across various columns. The column with the highest count of 5s is copied to the output matrix, where the value is changed to 1, while the column with the fewest 5s is also copied, and its value is altered to 2. Any columns that fall between the minimum and maximum frequencies are discarded. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions are same. Values: Input matrix contains only one non-zero value 5. Changed Values: The column containing 5 is chnaged to 1 and 2 depending on the reasoning
a64e4611;reasoning: The input matrix consists of scattered non-zero values arranged with empty spaces in between. These empty spaces are filled with 3s, ensuring that there is one row and one column of 0s separating the existing non-zero values from the added 3s. The 3s are only inserted into large blocks of empty space, rather than being placed in smaller, scattered gaps. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions are the same, Values: There is one non zero value in the input matrix. Changed Values: some cells containing the value 0 are changed to 3 based on the reasoning
a65b410d;reasoning: The input matrix features a row partially filled with the value 2. The total number of 2s in this row is noted, and in the row directly below, one fewer cell is filled with the value 1. This pattern continues, with each subsequent row filled with one less cell of 1 until only a single cell is filled. Conversely, in the rows above the row containing the 2s, the number of cells filled increases by one, with each filled cell assigned the value 3. This process continues upward until reaching the topmost row. Dimension: The input and output dimension remain the same. Values: The input matrix contains the value 2. Changed Values: some cells containing 0s are changed to 1s and 3s based on the reasoning
a68b268e;"reasoning: The input matrix has the value 1 located at the center of the middle row and column, effectively dividing the matrix into four 4x4 sections. The first section serves as the reference, with all non-zero values copied to the output matrix in their corresponding positions. The zeros in the first section are identified, and their positions are compared with the other three sections. If a non-zero value exists in any of these corresponding positions, that value is inserted into the output matrix; if all values in those positions are zero, the output matrix will retain a zero in that cell. Dimensions: The input dimension is 9 by 9 and output dimension is 4 by 4. Values: 1s divide the input matrix into 4 matrices with each having non zero values and zero values.

a740d043;reasoning: The input matrix has a background value of 1, with other non-zero values arranged in various shapes. These non-zero values are selected to create an internal matrix. If any of the values in this internal matrix include 1, those values will be changed to 0 in the output matrix, while all other values will remain unchanged. Dimensions: The output dimension depends on the internal matrix that is formed by the shape. Value: 1 is the background value and other non zero values form a shape. Changed Values: 1s are changed to 0s
a78176bb;reasoning: The input matrix contains diagonals filled with non-zero values, with certain values of 5 also positioned along these diagonals. In the output matrix, the original diagonal will be preserved, and a new diagonal will be formed based on the position of the value 5 that is farthest from the diagonal. This new diagonal will extend diagonally incorporating the same non-zero value as the existing diagonal. Consequently, the output matrix will display the original diagonal alongside the newly created diagonal. Dimensions: The input and output dimensions remain the same. Values: There is one non zero vlaue in the form of diagonal and group of 5s attached to the diagonal. Changed Values: The new diagonals are formed and added to the output matrix
